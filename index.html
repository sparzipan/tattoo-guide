          <h3>Research, Ask Questions, Don't Rush</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Research artists online to get an idea of the style you like and the art styles that appeal to you the most. Most artists can be found on their own shop website, on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, or even Pinterest.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collect reference material and examples of styles you like as you go.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research their locations and how they like you to go about booking – some are happy for you to contact them directly via social media but others will only respond to email enquiries as it can become overwhelming if they are a popular
              artist.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you really love an artist and they are nearby, it’s always a good idea to go to the shop in person for a consultation. You can then get a vibe of the shop, the artist, view their portfolio, ask questions and they can talk ideas
              through with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t rush into the first artist you find, and always notice the hygiene and cleanliness of the shop if you visit in person. Search for recommendations and reviews and always check out the artist’s portfolio.

          <h3>Question Yourself, Imagine</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do you want to add more connecting tattoos in this area in the future?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you want consistent black and grey or do you want to commit to colour?
            </li>
            <li>
              Am you okay with people asking you about your tattoos? Can you handle the occasional ignorance and sometimes blatant rudeness?
            </li>
            <li>
              Could the location of this tattoo affect your job options? Although we wish it weren’t the case, face, neck and hand tattoos are still widely frowned upon or unacceptable in a lot of jobs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Is this design really close to your heart or have you been swept away by something?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does the artist you like have flash designs available or are you looking for a custom design?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="separator">
          <p class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
        </div>
        <div id="limits" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Understand Limits, Listen to the Professional</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Know that what you imagine in your mind cannot always be executed as a tattoo for various reasons. Always remember that the body is not the same as a flat piece of paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              If an artist offers a more workable idea or refuses to do a certain design there will always be a valid, professional reason. They will always offer alternative ways to make your idea workable as a tattoo on the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              The tatto artist is most qualified to know what will look good and work best together and also give you a tattoo that will stand the test of time and look its best for as long as possible.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="separator">
          <p class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
        </div>
        <div id="material" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Source Material</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You will have the most positive experience if you can provide good quality images and descriptions of how you would like your tattoo to look.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t send a tonne of pictures, just find the best 3-4 that sum up what you want the best, maybe include an image of the artist’s previous work that you like the style of.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be specific about what colours you like or if you prefer black and grey, some artists specialise in one or the other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decide on size and placement – where do you want your tattoo to be on your body? How much space do you want it to occupy? Is there an area that you definitely don’t want it to be? Do you want it to be obviously visible to others/in your
              work clothes?
            </li>
            <li>
              Send a picture of the spot on your body that you’d like the tattoo to be, or pop in to the shop in person – you will definitely need to go for an in-person consultation if you are going for a cover-up as they will need to trace the old
              tattoo in order to come up with a design to work around it.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div id="patient" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Be Patient and Flexible: It’s Worth the Wait</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A lot of really great artists are booked up solid for months in advance, but this is a good sign. It means they are working hard and working well. Some shops offer walk-in days so look out for these if you are looking for something
              small and you don’t want to wait.
            </li>
            <li>
              Artists often advertise last minute cancellations on their social media but they get snapped up quickly so look out for these too.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are willing to wait a while or be flexible on days (you can book a weekday off work instead of booking a Saturday, for example) it will be worth it in the end.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some artists also work at tattoo conventions and offer up appointments for these or walk-up time slots during the day.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="separator">

        </div>
        <div id="travel" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Consider Travelling</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you’re looking for a big, important piece, consider travelling to find your perfect artist.
            </li>
            <li>
              You could turn it into a holiday and add even more sentiment to the tattoo experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="separator">

        <div id="deposit" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Be Prepared to Pay a Deposit</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If it’s your first time being tattooed by this artist you will definitely need to pay a deposit to secure your appointment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tattoo artists suffer a lot of last minute no-shows and if they had booked up a full day slot, this can leave them high and dry for the whole day, so it’s important to leave a deposit.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount you are expected to leave can vary from artist to artist. Some want a set percentage of the total quoted price, some have a fixed amount.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t forget, the deposit goes towards the final cost of your tattoo.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you need to cancel, some deposits can be transferable to another appointment if you want to re-book but this also varies from artist to artist so make sure to ask.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you cancel last minute or don’t show up at all there is a high chance you will lose your deposit completely.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Prepare your Aftercare</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Research a few aftercare products online and see what your personal requirements are. Click <a href="#aftercare-list">here</a> for some of my favourite products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you want a vegetarian product? Vegan? Not tested on animals? Free from parabens/preservatives? Are you a nut allergy sufferer? Any other allergies? Do you have naturally dry skin? Do you have a budget? Are you sensitive to strong
              smells? How much will you need?
            </li>
            <li>
              There are some great handmade aftercare products out there, all as awesome as the last so it’s really down to your own personal preference and budget. I personally love Inkmedix aftercare oil or <a href="https://uk.lush.com/"
                target="_blank">Ultrabalm</a> from Lush – both of them last a while and you don’t need much for each application. They are animal friendly, use natural products and are a middle of the range price.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy</a> has some lovely handmade tattoo aftercare balms, oils, creams and elixirs.

        <div id="comfort" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Be Comfortable and Considerate</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You will want to be as comfortable as possible for the duration of your tattoo so wear loose fitting clothing and comfortable footwear that allows the artist to access the area being tattooed easily. You might also want to wear old or
              black clothing incase you get any ink etc. on them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to keep as still as possible and don’t move around if you’re talking. Let your artist know if you’re about to sneeze!
            </li>
            <li>
              Be aware of personal hygiene. Your artist is probably going to be quite close to you for a while so make sure to shower and deodorise before you go along to your appointment and wear clean clothing. Keep your hair away from the area
              being tattooed. Don’t wear any strong perfumes/aftershaves as this can be off-putting at close range.
            </li>
            <li>
              Speak up if you need to have a drink, something to eat, go to the loo, might pass out or need a break for a bit – a good artist will welcome this and will want you to be as comfortable as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be polite and considerate to all those around you. There may be others around you being tattooed that need peace and quiet in order to deal with it, so be mindful of not being too noisy, invading others’ personal space or asking
              questions that cross boundaries.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div id="care" class="tip-section">
          <h3>Look After your Body and Mind</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Undergoing a tattoo is a stress on the body; adrenaline will start to flow as your body goes through physical damage, so it’s important to ensure you are in the best physical and mental state to experience as little discomfort as
              possible and heal as quickly as possible with no infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t drink/do drugs the night before or on the day of the tattoo. Not only does alcohol dehydrate you, it also prevents your blood from clotting as quickly and can cause you to bleed more than normal during the tattoo. You don’t want
              to be in close proximity to your artist and smell of booze, either.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drink plenty of water to hydrate yourself; this is especially important if you are prone to fainting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eat a good meal the night before and have a good breakfast on the day of your tattoo to keep your energy levels up, especially if you’re in for full day session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take one sugary drink/snack and one savoury snack (it's important to keep your salt levels balanced too) and a bottle of water with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always ask your artist to stop if you feel unwell or like you might faint - it’s nothing to be embarrassed about and being tattooed affects everyone differently. This is important for your own safety and the safety of others in the
              area.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember to breathe normally throughout the tattoo; when we are in pain it's easy to brace ourselves and forget to breathe which can end up making us feel worse.
            </li>
            <li>
              These days there are options to numb the area being tattooed, but it is very important to do your research on the after/side effects of using this cream before committing to it, and consider your pain threshold carefully and if you
              really need it.
            </li>

          <h3>After the Tattoo</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The area is an open wound after the tattoo is complete; keep the dressing that you left the shop with on for at least the first 2 hours and then carefully remove it. Don’t submerge the fresh tattoo in water or apply anything to it for
              the first 24 hours, just allow it to ooze and settle down, remembering not to touch it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t do anything that may cause you to bump or rub your new tattoo for the rest of the day/night.
            </li>
            <li>
              After 24/48 hours your can gently wash the tattoo with lukewarm water and a little soap using only your clean fingers. Still don’t submerge your tattoo underwater for another day or so.
            </li>
            <li>
              After this time you can start to apply your aftercare product according to its own individual advice. With most, you gently apply a thin coating to the area about 2-3 times a day for a couple of weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NEVER PICK OR SCRATCH YOUR TATTOO!</strong> You could end up with an infection or pull some of the ink out, causing it to look patchy when it heals.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you notice any pus or yellow/green liquid oozing out of the tattoo, or if the tattoo has a large area of redness around it that continues on after the first 4-5 days (redness around the tattoo is normal for the first few days as all
              the blood cells rush to the area to promote healing) then you should seek advice from your doctor/pharmacist as this can be a sign of infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have any worries or concerns, always drop your artist a line and if you feel feverish or faint at any time after your tattoo always call your doctor/pharmacist for advice.
